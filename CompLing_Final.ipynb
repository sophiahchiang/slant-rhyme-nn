        "# Small test corpus (Sean)\n",
        "corpus = '''\n",
        "         IN A SHORT speech on November 19th Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, made a humiliating U-turn. Barely a year after rushing a trio of laws reforming agriculture through parliament, he announced their repeal. The shame was not only to have handed victory to the horde of tractor-mounted yokels doggedly protesting at the gates of India’s capital since last November. It was to have bungled the issue from the start. Indian farming does indeed desperately need reform. Yet Mr Modi made no effort to build consensus for his three new laws last year, instead ramming them through parliament without debate. When north Indian farmers, many of whom happen to be Sikh, protested, he doubled their fury by tagging them thugs and traitors. The most powerful Indian leader in a generation then did nothing for months, as if the stand-off were someone else’s problem. That is, not until elections in a couple of important farm states drew uncomfortably near, whereupon Mr Modi crumpled completely. In another democracy a leader who flouted parliament, broke trust with an influential religious minority and insisted on and then scrapped controversial reforms would pay a heavy political price. But although the farm-bill fiasco is only the latest link in a long and heavy chain of embarrassments under Mr Modi, the white-bearded prime minister remains largely unscathed. Admirers ascribe his staying power to personal charisma. They say he projects the strength and dignity Indian voters crave in their own lives. Detractors point instead to the deep pockets, ruthlessness and military discipline of his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), quietly buttressed by a web of allied Hindu-nationalist organisations and noisily amplified by relentless propaganda. All this surely counts, yet would not suffice without another secret weapon: the opposition. Throughout Mr Modi’s term and a half in power, the BJP’s opponents have remained divided, weak and largely ineffectual. This does not mean they have given the prime minister a free ride. Such misguided policies as “demonetisation”, the withdrawal from circulation in 2016 of high-denomination notes in a delusional bid to chase out “black money”, or the BJP’s gleeful stoking of Islamophobia in a country with 200m Muslims, or Mr Modi’s erratic handling of covid-19, including fierce lockdowns that wrecked small businesses and stranded millions of migrant workers, followed by complacent laxity as India’s second wave became a murderous tsunami—all this has made it easy for opposition politicians to fire up disgruntled constituents. But despite landing the odd blow against Mr Modi, and beating the BJP in the occasional state election, they have so far failed to shift India’s broader narrative. In opposition in the years before 2014, the BJP had by contrast skilfully and relentlessly undermined the sitting government, plucking at every speck of possible evidence to build a damning—and in retrospect largely unfair—picture of weakness and venality.\n",
